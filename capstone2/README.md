# Capstone 2: NBA Salary Predictor and Team Optimization Project
## Austin Cody

Starting with a csv file of NBA player statistics from the 2022-2023 season, this project aims to use supervised machine learning to predict player salaries and then find the optimal team constrained by a budget, team size, and balance of player positions.

This project consists of 4 Jupyter Notebooks:
1. Data Wrangling
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Data Preprocessing
4. Modeling
